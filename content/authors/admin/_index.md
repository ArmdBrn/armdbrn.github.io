I am Maitre de Conférences (~ Associate Professor) at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1.

My research focuses on problems originating from physics in which a stochastic component plays a key role. This randomness mostly originates from molecular behaviors, such as inter-collisions and interactions with the boundary in kinetic theory, from some extra microstructure, or from diffusive effects when studying nonlinear diffusions.
Mathematically, the tools I use come mainly from probability theory (Harris theorem, coupling techniques, stochastic calculus) and from the theory of partial differential equations.

Before moving to Lyon, I was a Civis3I Postdoctoral Fellow (part of the MSCA action) at University La Sapienza, under the supervision of [Alessandra Faggionato](https://www1.mat.uniroma1.it/people/faggionato/).
Before that, I was a postdoc researcher at the LJLL (Sorbonne Université), under the supervision of [Mitia Duerinckx](http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~mduerinc/) (FNRS) and [Antoine Gloria](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/~gloria/index.html) (LJLL, SU).
I studied for my PhD at the LPSM (Sorbonne Université) under the supervision of [Nicolas Fournier](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/fournier/) (LPSM, Sorbonne Université) and
 [Stéphane Mischler](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~mischler/index.html) (CEREMADE, Université Paris Dauphine).
